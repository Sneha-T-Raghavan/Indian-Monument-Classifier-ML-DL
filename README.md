Overview

The Indian Monument Classification project is a machine learning and deep learning-based framework designed to classify structures and monuments based on eight distinct Indian architectural styles: Buddhist, Indo-Islamic, Rajput, Dravidian, Hindu, Sikh, British, and Modern. 
This project bridges technology and cultural heritage preservation by providing a scalable method to categorize and document architectural styles, highlighting their historical, cultural, and artistic significance. Using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) for feature extraction and a combination of traditional machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) and advanced deep learning models (DenseNet, InceptionV3), the framework achieves high accuracy, with DenseNet leading at 86% and InceptionV3 at 79%. 
This project contributes to heritage preservation by enabling automated and accurate classification of architectural styles.
